Python2 vs Python3:


Before you start, note that there are differences between different versions of
Python (on pythonanywhere.com when you start a console it lets you choose a version).
If you get errors due to using functions that changed from Python2 > Python3 then try
to find the Python3 equivalent/work-around (you'll see an example of a difference in
the first exercise).

Python2 is most used in industry at the moment but it will be useful for you to learn
Python3 and if any of the tutorials you use only work in Python2, try to find the correct
Python3 version of the code.



Exercises:


1. User Input

  Instructions:
  - When the program is run, it should wait for the user to input something.
  - Upon user input, the program should output "You just said {user_input}" where
    {user_input} is the message that the user just typed.
  - When the user types "exit", the program should stop.

  Hints:
  - Use a while loop that will keep executing as long as the user has not typed "exit"
